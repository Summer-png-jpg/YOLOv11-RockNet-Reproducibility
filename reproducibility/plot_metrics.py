This script documents the plotting procedure for evaluation metrics.

Training curves (PR, Precision–Confidence, Recall–Confidence, F1–Confidence)
are generated during training and are not reconstructed from trained weights.

This file is provided to clarify the evaluation workflow and plotting logic.
